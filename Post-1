Taking inspiration from this traditional and iconic men’s garment, many new fusion dhoti-inspired designs are a big part of the latest fashion trends in India.

<h3>The Saree-Kurta Duo</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you get bored of wearing the same old Indian classic in the same old way, this outfit idea is a winner for you. Combine two of the greatest Indian wear silhouettes in one of the boldest and experimental Indian fashion trends – the kurta-saree set! Instead of pairing your Kurtis for women with the usual pants, salwar, pajama or churidar, opt for a saree instead. Lengthen the palla of your saree and lessen the pleated area to reduce bulk underneath in order to adapt the&nbsp;saree’s drape&nbsp;to a kurta length to effectively execute one of the latest fashion trends of the season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em><strong>Styling Cue:</strong></em>&nbsp;You can opt for a wide range of&nbsp;types of Kurtis, but the one we recommend is an empire-line angrakha or kalidar for this look to add a stylish and experimental flamboyance overall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The Brocade Jumpsuit</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Simple, elegant and effective. Make a statement of minimalistic Indian style in a brocade jumpsuit. Opt for a neat silhouette with clean lines and sleek structure crafted in a stunning traditional brocade fabric to make a big impression in the latest fashion trends of neo-Indian wear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em><strong>Styling Cue:</strong></em>&nbsp;Add a traditional jadau or an elaborate oxidised jewellery piece that stands out and elevates this stunning look for the summer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The Blazered Lehenga</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This outfit idea is Indian power-dressing at its finest! Instead of going for the usual choli-lehenga combo, opt for a blazer on the top. Giving the wearer a well-defined profile and an ultra-stylish look, this outfit looks best when color-coordinated in a monochrome. Instead of choosing a lehenga with the usual kalis, go for a gathered lehenga that gives a fluffy and modern flare to your silhouette.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em><strong>Styling Cue:</strong></em>&nbsp;Combine western influences and the latest fashion trends by adding a classic watch and oversized clutch to complete this look.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The French Knot Eleganza</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most intricate and delicate hand embroidery techniques, french knots are dainty threaded knots that are often used in Indian wear for adding subtle and extra pretty finishes to edges and hems. Opt for an Indian outfit that features this stylish embellishment, or if you would like to get creative, get yourself some anchor thread and an embroidery needle to go DIY with your fave Indian outfit after watching a simple tutorial online.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who said the latest fashion trends can’t be free or customized! You can also add these to boho-inspired&nbsp;dresses for women&nbsp;to give them a dainty and chic upgrade.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>The Luxury Pajama</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are looking for an Indian outfit that can go with your indoors and WFH vibe flawlessly, this trend is the one for you! Opt for a light cotton or muslin indoors pajama set that is elevated by luxe finishings and hand block-printing or thread embroideries. Cozy, stylish, and a great way to stay presentable as you operate indoors, this is the most relevant of the latest fashion trends in the Indian wear scene.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
